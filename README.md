# Real-Challenge-1
## Alt Attributes
I added these attributes to every image to improve the accessibility of the site and improve the SEO of the website.
## Navigation Bug
I fixed a bug in the navigation system that would not allow a user to go to the Search-Engine-Optimization section of the webpage, when clicking on the 
link at the top of the page.
## Clearer and Concise Code
Certain classes had unspecific names, which does not help the accessibility or readability of the code in general. Therefore, they had to be changed in order
to make them more semantic. For instance, replacing a div tag with a nav tag.
## Made Small Adjustments to Improve the Visisual Aspect 
I changed the font-size to improve the aesthetic. In almost every case I enlarged the font-size, because it had previously not been as large as it should have 
given the space it was alotted. I also changed the line-height for certain elements, as I felt that they were not proportional to their content. There were other small changes that were made, which in one way or another were aimed at improving the look of the website.
